# Introduction To Programming

## Evolution of Computing Devices

* 1940s-ENIAC was amongst the first computing system.It was equal to 
the size of 3-4 double-decker buses.
* Vaccum Tubes were size of a thumb.
* 1947-the **transistors** were a fraction the size of the vaccum tubes.
* 1958- Integrated Circuits(Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce).
* 1968-Intel Electronics(Robert Noyce).

# Binary Number System
* Base 2 Number System.
* Computers only understant 0 and 1.
* 0 and 1 are also called bit **Binary Digit**.
* 8 bit is one byte.
* A byte can represent 256 values.
* 2^x place multiplier.

* 0-0
* 1-1
* 2-10
* 3-11
* 4-100

# Logic Gates
* .AND 
* .OR
* .NOT
* .XOR
* .NAND

# Combinational Circuits
* Half Adder
* Full Adder
* Subtractors
* Multipliers
 
 # Memory Classification
 * Registers
 * Cache
 * Primary Memory(RAM)
 * Secondary Memory(Hard Disks etc.)

 # Programming Language Hierarchy
 * Machine Language
 * Assembly Language
 
 # High Level Language
 Fortran,Algol in 1950s and 60s.
 Compiler-> machine specific assembler-> Machine language.

 # Stack and Heap
 * Stack and Heap memory space used by programs.
 * Allocated on RAM
 * Sizes are OS Specific
 * Stack is used for static memory allocation
 * Heap is for dynamic memory allocation

 # Stack
 * All local variables.
 * All function calls area allocated here.
 * Can't change size once declared.
 * LIFO operation.
 * Uses stack pointer to keep track.

 # Heap
 * Dynamic variables.
 * Global Access,can be referenced from anywhere in the application.
 * Can be accessed and assigned anywhere.
