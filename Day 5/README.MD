# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
## Introduction to JavaScript

 JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support.

## Comment Your JavaScript Code

    Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.

    There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
    * // This is an in-line comment.
    * /* This is a multi-line comment. */

## Declare JavaScript Variables
    JavaScript variables are container for storing data values.
    JavaScript provides seven different data types which are 

* undefined
* null
* boolean
* string
* symbol
* number
* object

 ## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
   In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.
   eg: myVariable = 5;
      This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.
